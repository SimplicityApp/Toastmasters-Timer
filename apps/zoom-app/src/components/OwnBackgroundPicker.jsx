 * Pick the background the timer puts back when a speech ends.
 *
 * Shown in two places — the Card Images modal and its own modal off the mode
 * menu — so it is a section rather than a dialog of its own.
 *
 * Why it exists: without one, handing the organizer their background back means
 * asking Zoom what they had and asking for its pixels, across APIs that are not
 * in the shipped SDK typing, that a client may grant none of, and that name a
 * background by an id the pixel call need not accept. Every way that fails ends
 * with the organizer somewhere they did not choose. An image stored here is the
 * answer to "what should I be on", so the restore has nothing left to get wrong.
